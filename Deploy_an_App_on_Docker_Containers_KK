The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. 
The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. 
The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. 
Below are the details of the task:
1.	On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file /opt/dba/docker-compose.yml (should be named exactly).
2.	The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:
For web service:
a. Container name must be php_apache.
b. Use image php with any apache tag. Check here for more details https://hub.docker.com/_/php?tab=tags.
c. Map php_apache container's port 80 with host port 8082
d. Map php_apache container's /var/www/html volume with host volume /var/www/html.
For DB service:
a. Container name must be mysql_apache.
b. Use image mariadb with any tag (preferably latest). Check here for more details https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=tags.
c. Map mysql_apache container's port 3306 with host port 3306
d. Map mysql_apache container's /var/lib/mysql volume with host volume /var/lib/mysql.
e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_apache and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.
3.	After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command curl <server-ip or hostname>:8082/
